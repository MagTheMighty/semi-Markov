# semi-Markov
Closed semi Markov process that uses various methods for optimization 

The goal of this is to take model postive, recurrent matrix for a finite amount of states and then employ various known methods for solving non linear optimization.

1. define the states
2. define the probabilities of acheiving the 'next' state...maybe with skiping a state?
3. input controls that may effect state transition
4. output is time series of state transiston, numerically and graphically
